                <div><h3>Telepresence Robot</h3></div>
                <p>
                    Built a humanoid robot (nick named as BROBOT) using cost effective simple
                    material like paper, thin metallic cables and basic electronics. This robot has multiple degrees of freedom. 
                    This robot was showcased in Maker fair.
                </p>

                <div><h3>Sentry robot with Computer vision</h3></div>
                <p>
                    This robot was built with Cardboard and paper - with a lot of electronics build into it.
                    This robot had a camera mounted - which transmitted the pictures to computer. 
                    This robot was showcased in college annual day function.

                <div><h3>Security robot</h3></div>
                <p>
                    The robot was designed and developed when I was an intern. 
                    This was intended to monitor some specific area - transmit pictures. 
                    The movements and actions of it was controllable using a remote computer.

                <div><h3>Conversion of IC engine vehicle to an electric vehicle</h3></div>
                <p>
                    One old van was bought and was converted  to an electric vehicle. 
                    This involved the design of capacity of motor, battery needed, dis assembling of existing engine and 
                    other components and fitting the newly designed and procured items. This project also involved procurement
                    of items - for which we had to do a lot of market survey. Project was a start in the new direction 
                    of automobile industry - we could achieve a speed of 20 kmph. This was showcased in college.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Modelling was one of the first things I started.
                    Many 3D models - Art work - was made. Using software like Papacura the design was done.
                    All the models were done using paper. Some of the models developed were - Stag, Wolf, Steel Man helmet.
                    These were showcased in Maker fair exhibition.

                <p>
                    A game named doodle Jump was developed using UNITY game development software.
                    It involved some programming in C#.
